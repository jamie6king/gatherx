This directory should contain the following avatar images:

1. robot.png
2. alien.png
3. cyborg.png
4. ghost.png

You can create or download your own avatar images and place them here.
For testing, you can use any 100x100 pixel images with transparent backgrounds.

If no images are provided, the application will still work, but the avatar images won't be displayed on the landing page.
